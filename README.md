# Retail-Store-Analysis
Tata Virtual Internship 

Ellaborating the steps involved in the process for data analysis in retail store.

Step 1: Data Collection - Data source was tata itself. I had not to worry about data collection here. 

Step 2: Data Cleaning - In description column there was a lot inappropriate values like - 20713, ??missing, ???, ???damages, ???lost etc. I deleted these values from the sheet. Quantity column has many -ve values that i removed and deleted values like 0 to get relevant & correct insights.

Step 3: Data Processing - 1). Add price column to the table. 2). Add month & year column to see monthly trend. 

Step 4: Data Analysis - Data was set to perform analysis. I transformed data into meaningful insights.

Step 5: Interpret Results - Created visuals to represent data and interpret those chart and graphs to inhance readability. I have used stacked column chart, Line chart, Bar chart to design visuals.

Conclusion - February, March & April has the lowest sales so provide some coupon and offers to customers. To expand globally I categorized the five countries where the revenue is less than 1% but I also need to study the market in these countries. Looking at the top 10 customers I recognized that they should need to make more competitive shopping environment because top 10 customer are contributing 38% in total revenue.
